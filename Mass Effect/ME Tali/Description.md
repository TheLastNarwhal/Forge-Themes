A pleasant purple Tali'Zorah themed skin for Forge with custom buttons and game icons.

The font is straight from the Mass Effect games and it's a bit large, so I would recommend that you change the font size to be the smallest possible. You'll still end up with a bit of runoff, but... the font is cool, so worth it.
